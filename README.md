# Micropen-Toolchain
A open source based toolchain that makes possible fast setting and development with IDE capabilities, less dependencies and specifics knowledge.

### How it works?
The application create a workspace for a specific IDE, some simplifications and set up the build task with customization, reducing work at project start and keeping regardless their size.

## Starting
We just need basically 3 applications (according you platform):

- **KDevelop IDE `(Based version: 5.3.0)`**, a open source IDE Cross-Platform based on Qt libraries and KDE Frameworks.

[`KDevelop website`](https://www.kdevelop.org/) 

- **SDCC - Small Device C Compiler `(Based version: 3.8.3)`**, a open source compiler suite for "Intel MCS51 based microprocessors (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390 variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08), Zilog Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit 2000/3000, Rabbit 3000A, TLCS-90) and STMicroelectronics STM8".

[`SDCC suite website`](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) 

- **Python `(Based version: 3.7.2rc1)`**, the program core of the toolchain.

[`Python website`](https://www.python.org/)

See all their specifications about setting up the applications at your system and including at PATH.
